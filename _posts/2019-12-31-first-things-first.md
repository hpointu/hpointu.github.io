That's it, we're live

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I've decided to start a dev blog.

I want to write a game, and I figured keeping a blog would help keeping me
motivated.  So here we go, I have no idea how to use this tool though so it
might take a few days or weeks until I have something readable.

As for the game itself, I've decided to give myself a few months to come up with
a basic prototype. No fancy graphics or whatever but I want to expore some
features space and see what works and what doesn't. Depending how it goes, I'll
develop the idea further. But because I have a full time job, as well as other
side projects, I will only be able to dedicate a limited amount of time to that
game prototype. That's fine, I still have time. My arbitrary deadline is set to
the 1st of May 2020. Youhou.

Nice talking to my text editor,
See you soon
