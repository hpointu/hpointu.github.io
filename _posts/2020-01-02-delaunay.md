I'm doing my experiments with the Godot game engine because I find it quite
powerful and easy to use. And I recently discovered that the beta-3.2 now
includes a ready to use Delaunay triangulation algorithm. I thought I could play
with this to generate my map!

I should probably write my own version of it at some point because I'll have to
recompute things that the function doesn't give me, but necessarily had to
compute such as the cirucumcircles of the triangles.  The ready to use function
only gives the resulting triangles. But I'll have a go with it and experiment a
bit. If it's not helping me to create my maps, I wouldn't have written my own
version for nothing :)

So, I'll use that to generate some [Voronoi
polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) for my maps and see
what I can do with this. My hope is that this will give to my maps more
interesting shapes, while still fully controlling the underlying graph. The
Delaunay will give me a mesh to render while the Voronoi will hold "regions"
information (which I can use to deform my mesh for example or even AI path
finding)
