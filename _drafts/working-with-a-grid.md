I don't particularly want to have a grid in my game. The player will be able to
create buildings on a map, but I thought it would be nice if there wasn't too
much constraints on where to place every building. I don't see why it should be
constrained.

That being said, I reckon having some sort of grid will make path finding a bit
easier for example. So I wonder if I can make some sort of hybrid.

I really have no idea...
